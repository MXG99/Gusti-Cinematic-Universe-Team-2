**_It's not invisible, just unseen._** A battle of ideas, strength, power. Lamb Like and The Lion often fight without being in the spotlight. Recently Fox Fighter and his friend, Serpent King, have been advancing some shrewd and dangerous ideas. Ideas control minds. Minds control people. **"We have the right to believe everything, but not everything we believe is right."**
