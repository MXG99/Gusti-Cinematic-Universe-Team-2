# The Lion 

He's known as a normal guy, but the moment you'll try to attack his principles, you'll get to see why he's called The Lion. He's really concerned about security, so he never posts his pic online, he replaces it with a pic that represents his nickname. He's LambLike's half brother.

## Powers and weaknesses

- ➕ Speaks - and understands - every single language known on Earth (including those that don't have a written form yet)
- ➕ Strong will (NEVER stops until he achieves his goal)
- ➕ Empathy
- ➖ Stutters sometimes
